By (a) converting Central Kurdish words into English characters, we used transfer learning from English. (b) completely training the attention mechanism utilizing the pre-trained English model[1] with the learned English characters integration. The audio training samples were down-sampled to 22050-Hz in order to use the similar audio parameter as an open-source implementation[2] (trained on the LJS-speech dataset), such as hop length and filter length.
And later in the paper, there is even a [3]... May god be with you!
